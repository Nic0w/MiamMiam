MiamMiam is a web application developped for ESIEAâ€™s lecture web programming in last year by Nicolas BROQUET and Sylvain PRUDHON.

The aim of this app  is to propose the best recipe that you can cook with the food ingredients that you have.
======================

You must be registered before researching any recipe. To do that, you have a register part on the home page.
Once sign in you will be directly on your personnal page. You will have a list of your previously research and a part for your new research. You have to check the ingredients you have and validate your choice to see the recipe that we are proposing to you.

On this app you have an admin part. The admin can : see a profil and delete it, see a recipe and delete it and finally add a recipe.
